This website is like a customer service representative. It is bright, modern, and inviting so that my audience will feel more welcome on your page.
Giving the impression that I am open and welcoming to new people who visit the website. My website is about a cafe (le cafe) based here in Addis. 
I have tried to show my understanding of mainly HTML and CSS. The website also includes SVG shapes based on our lesson which I applied and I've tried my best and managed to create the ‘Instagram’ logo. 
This Website is more or less targeted towards the younger generation as you can tell by the overall aesthetics and the pictures chosen but it's simple so really anyone can use it.
